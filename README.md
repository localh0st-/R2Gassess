Steps to compile and run:
1) clone the repo
2) run "maven install" in the proper directory, which will build a jar file in the newly created 'target' directory
3) run with "java -jar takehome-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar"

All commands must be fully uppercased (e.g. `LIST WAREHOUSES`). In the case of parameters however, this is not the case.
